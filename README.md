# Quangdao's Benchmarks

I've been created random standalone local benchmarking projects, so I decided to just create a central one that's version controlled.

```
dotnet run -c Release
```

This opens the benchmark switcher and will prompt you to select which benchmarks to run. To run all of them, enter `*`.
