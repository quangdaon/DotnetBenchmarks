# Quangdao's Benchmarks

I've created random standalone local benchmarking projects, so I decided to just create a central one that's version controlled.

## Running the Benchmarks

```
dotnet run -c Release
```

This opens the benchmark switcher and will prompt you to select which benchmarks to run. To run all of them, enter `*`.

## Selecting Benchmarks to Run

Edit the Program.cs file.
